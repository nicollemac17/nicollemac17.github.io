subtitle: Why I am taking CSCI 103

## About Me: 
I'm a sophomore theater (and art history ?) major that comes to the Berkshires from Knoxville, TN. 

## I am taking this class for the following reasons:
- I have always wanted to take a Computer Science Course
- I love sewing and knitting. More specifically, I learned how to hand sew in the 7th grade, and have been using it randomly for the past few years. I recently went to a thrift store, found a sewing machine, and decided to buy it! I've been doing a few projects here and there, but nothing of intense quality.
- This class seemed like a great combination of some of the interests that I do not get to commonly explore!
