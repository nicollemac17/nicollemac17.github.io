## About Me: 
I'm a sophomore theater (and art history ?) major that comes to the Berkshires from Knoxville, TN. 

## I am taking this class for the following reasons:
- I have always wanted to take a Computer Science Course
- I love sewing and knitting 
- This class semed like a great combination of some of the interests that I do not get to commonly explore!
