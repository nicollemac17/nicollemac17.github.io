### Details:
Write a C-program called sweater-abc1.c (where abc1 is your Unix username). This program will print out the answers to the following questions, using arithmetic. You will have an integer variable called temperature that the programmer can set to have any integer value. Depending on temperature, your program will output a statement to describe the appropriate weather gear for that temperature (i.e., if it's below 60 degrees, your program may write something like "SWEATER WEATHER", if it's above a certain temperature it should say something different). Here are some constraints to address:

The program's output must depend on the value set in temperature.
You must use at least an if statement, an else if statement, and an else statement that all print something different.
Each of your if / else if / else statements should be reachable, simply by changing the value of temperature.
Appropriate use of the and and or operators.
Consider the following possible values for temperature: -50, 0, 32, 70, 100, 2000 (but note that your code should respond appropriately for any integer value).
