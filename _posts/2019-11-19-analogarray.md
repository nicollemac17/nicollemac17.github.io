## Assignment:
Learn how to use arrays, and by doing so take a random PWM pin and select a random brightness. Turn the light on for a second, then turn it off. Then repeat with a different brightness and another random PWM pin.

## Some advice I would give my past self:
I was so overwhelmed with this assignment, that it was paralyzing. The TAs are a great help.

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
