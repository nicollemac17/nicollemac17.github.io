## Assignment:
Design a project that must include 2 Inputs and 2 Outputs. At least 1 analog input, 1 analog output. At least one output controlled by input. Battery Holder switch does not count.

I decided to make mine have colorful lights, but when it gets hot and the lights are dark the blue lights turn on to remind you to drink water.

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Have a backup plan. I wanted to use a heart rate monitor but struggled with what to do when I realized that that wasn't a possible option. 

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!

XOXO,

Coding Girl!
