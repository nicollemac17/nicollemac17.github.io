# Hello! Welcome to _my_ new website!

I'm Nicolle Mac Williams, and I am a sophomore at the college. I'm declaring my major this semester, and I believe that I will be a Theatre and Art History double major.

## My Sewing Experience: 
* I learned to sew by hand when I was young. My grandfather taught me, and I have been using it on the rare occasion to repair clothing.
* In middle school, I took a class that taught me how to use a sewing machine. My skills have not gotten better since then. I hadn't used a sewing machine since that class until 2018 Winter Break. I went to a thrift store with my family, and I found a sewing machine! I thought it would be a good opportunity to try out sewing again -- I could definitely use more practice.
* I started knitting during Winter Study of 2019, and also do not have much technical skill, but I thoroughly enjoy doing it while watching a TV show or something like that. 

## My Programing Experience:
* Absolutely non-existent as of a few days ago. 
* This class has been the only opportunity that I've had so far to learn how to code! 

## What I hope to learn in class: 
I would like to have some practical coding skills as well as some knowledge of circuitry. I would also at some point like to take CSCI 134, so it would be great to have some experience with coding that would help me succeed in that course. 

#### One Boring Fact about Me: 
* I had a salad for dinner last night (aka Wednesday, September 11th, 2019).

The classes that I'm taking this semester (I just wanted to try this out):
