## Assignment:
The program will play SOS in morse code using a vibe if a switch is on, if it is off the vibe will spell out N-I-C-O-L-L-E, also known as my name! 

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Try to email the prof if you're sick and are going to miss class. Also, I know you're busy but make the time to go to Office Hours! I bet it would have helped a lot! 

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!

XOXO,

Coding Girl!
