## Assignment:
### 1. Project title: Responsible Party Jacket
#### Description: 
This jacket turns on LED lights and plays "Never Gonna Give You Up" when it is hot and dark in a room. The lights are blue so that you remember to drink water.
#### Movitation: 
I'm always dehydrated and it would be nice to have a reminder every once in a while. 

### 2. Materials list: 
 * 6 Blue LED lights 
 * Arduino board 
 * LiPo Rechargeable Battery
 * Temperature Sensor
 * Light Sensor 
 * Conductive Thread
 * Conductive Fabric 
 * Allegator Clips

### 3. Screenshot of your revised paper prototype of your project:

### 4. Photo of your alligator prototype working

### 6. 3 tips to your past self: 
 * Conductive thread is the worst and does not work. Please remember this going forward. 
 * TAs are your best friends. 
 * The ardunio board will heat up for some stupid reason, and please be careful if/when you touch it. My finger now has a burn. Try not to do this to yourself! 

### 7. Citations of any resources used
The music for "Never Gonna Give You Up" came from here: https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/blob/master/nevergonnagiveyouup/nevergonnagiveyouup.ino

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
