## Assignment: 
The assignment was to create a switch on the fabric that we used for our sewing sampler. I added some LED lights as well as use conductive fabric to accomplish this task.

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Start earlier! You have a problem set and a good amount of sewing to do! I also had to go through the sewing twice with extra conductive thread to get it to work. 


Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
