## Assignment:
I made a paper prototype of what my final project will look like. With this paper prototype we are meant to map out the circuitry of what the final prototype will actually be. It is an opportunity to make sure the design and placement of the components makes sense. Since my first design, things have been tweaked slightly so as to accomodate some more practical design. 

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
I was so overwhelmed with this assignment, that it was paralyzing. The TAs are a great help.

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!

XOXO,

Coding Girl!
