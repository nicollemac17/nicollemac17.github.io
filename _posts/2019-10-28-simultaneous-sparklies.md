## Assignment: 
The assignment was to program a code that reflected the light patterns of the fireflies from the Great Smoky Mountains (TN represent x2!) The twist is that now the program should reflect how the fireflies flash but all at once. This requires using multiple variables! 

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Ask for help! Don't wait to do so!
