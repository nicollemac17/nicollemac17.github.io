## Assignment: 
The assignment was to program a code that reflected the light patterns of the fireflies from the Great Smoky Mountains (TN represent x2!) The twist is that now the program should reflect how the fireflies flash but all at once. This requires using multiple variables! 

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Be incredibly careful about how you use the fade and other components to get the effect that you want in the Big Dipper assignment.


Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
