## Here is my newest attempt at embroidery!

This was a wonderful experience! I find it super relaxing to sew, and also be able to learn a new skill! 

### One thing that I wish I could tell my past self about this project:
Sewing is much more relaxing than it seems, but remember to schedule time to complete this in a timely manner (spread out over the week)

Thanks for visiting _my website!_

Take care :)
