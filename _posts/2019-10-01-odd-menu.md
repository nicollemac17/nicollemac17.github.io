## Assignment: 
With coding I made a menu that responds to random numbers that one selects. If you order using an even number, you order from the restaurant's regular menu. If you order using an odd number, you order from the restaurant's SECRET menu! The code accounts for the number choice as well as meal option (numbers 1 through 3) and gives you a specific meal. Both the secret menu and the advertized menu are some of my favorite foods, so you really can't go wrong! 

## Look for yourself!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Don't forget the commas and curly brackets. They really make a difference 

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
