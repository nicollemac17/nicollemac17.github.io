## Assignment: 
The assignment was to program a code that reflected the light patterns of the fireflies from the Great Smoky Mountains (TN represent!) Each firefly (Flashbulb, Synchronous, and the Big Dipper) each flash for a different duration and do different things. Each program must therefore be different to reflect their distinct flashing patterns.

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Be incredibly careful about how you use the fade and other components to get the effect that you want.


Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
