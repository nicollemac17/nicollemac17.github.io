## Assignment:
The program plays the Wii's Mii Channel music when the switch is on, and it does not play it when the switch is off. 

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Loops do exactly what you want them to do, they loop the music. Use this instead of the void - setup area. 

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
