## Assignment: 
The assignment was to program a code that will print the color RED 3 times, then Green 3 times, then Blue in the sequence of counting through a loop of 100. If it gets higher then it will repeat Red 3 times, and continues onwards. 


## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
TA hours are amazing! Realizing that there needs to be a second variable when you're accounting for 2 things is also amazing! 

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
