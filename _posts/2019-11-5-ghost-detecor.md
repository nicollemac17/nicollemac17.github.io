## Assignment:
The program turns on the red lights when it is cold enough for ghosts to be ~thriving~.

## Look at what I did!

## Some advice I would give my past self:
Make sure that the variables you're using are being used accurately. If TempSensor and TempValue both exist, make sure you're using them the right way!

Stay tuned for some more exciting coding adventures! Until next time!
